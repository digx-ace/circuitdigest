Step 1: Setup the SSD1306 OLED Display
Assuming you're using the I2C interface, you'll first need to set up the I2C communication and initialize the SSD1306 display.

Step 2: Adding the SSD1306 Library
You may need to include or write a driver for the SSD1306 OLED display. If you have an existing SSD1306 library (or can use one from a compatible platform), include that in your project. Hereâ€™s a simplified version assuming you have such a library available:

Step 3: Integrate the OLED Display in the Access Control System
Modify your access control system to display relevant messages on the OLED display:

Explanation:
I2C Initialization: The i2c_init() function sets up the I2C communication on the MAX78000. Adjust the I2C bus and address according to your setup.

SSD1306 Initialization: The ssd1306_init() function initializes the OLED display and clears it.

Displaying Messages: The display_message() function prints messages to the OLED display.

Access Control Integration: In the loop() function, the OLED display shows different messages depending on the face recognition result and the received password.

Considerations:
Ensure the SSD1306 driver is compatible with your setup and properly linked in your project.
If your OLED uses SPI instead of I2C, modify the initialization and communication functions accordingly.
